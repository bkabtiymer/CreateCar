# CreateCarApp #

Create a class called Car. The Car class should inherit from the Vehicle class. Car should contain the following:

private member variables
a default constructor
an overloaded constructor
methods which return a string indicating each task the car is performing.
For example, the accelerate method will return a string that says "The car is accelerating" and the setSpeed(90) method will return a string that says "The Speed is 90 mph". The application will also contain getters and setters for each private member variable.

Create another class called CarApp which contains the main method. In the main method create an instance of a Car.

Then print the output of the different methods as the car object is "operated".

Your output should look something like this:

The red Porsche is starting
The red Porsche is accelerating
The red Porsche is going 50 mph
The red Porsche is stopped

etc
